# transportation_networks_of_china
This data repository hosts datasets covering China's road and rail transportation networks. These datasets are compiled in *The Distributional Impacts of Transportation Networks in China* by Lin Ma and Yang Tang, published in the *Journal of International Economics*. To use the data, please cite:

"Lin Ma and Yang Tang. *The Distributional Impacts of Transportation Networks in China.* Journal of International Economics vol xxx (2024): 103873."

This dataset contains three components: 
  1) prefecture-to-prefecture commuting time,
  2) years and code of construction, and
  3) pixel-level design speed and travel time data.
   
The authors are still in the process of cleaning up parts (2) and (3), and you can access the raw data via the [Dropbox Link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/6cey5kdtqsfqyatn6xa43/h?rlkey=ycklu6jgstjlkiu2fa740iv21&dl=0) 

## Prefecture-to-Prefecture Travel Time

This data set records the prefecture-to-prefecture travel time in units of hours for three modes of transportation: road, railroad (freight), and railroad (passenger). The current version covers the years 1994 to 2017. The travel time is computed using the Fast Marching algorithm based on the pixel-level design speed. Ma and Tang (2024) provides more details on how to infer the pixel-level design speed and prefecture-to-prefecture travel time.
